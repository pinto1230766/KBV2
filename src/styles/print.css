  /* react-to-print usually handles this by creating an iframe or modifying styles temporarily. 
     However, ensuring global UI is hidden if using a different method is good.
     But react-to-print copies the specific node to a print window. 
     So we mainly need to ensure that WITHIN that node, 'no-print' class works. 
     The styles below are for the global app if we were printing window.print() directly on the page, 
     but react-to-print isolates content. 
     So actually, we just need standards.
